**Hello, my name is Andrew Weymouth** and I have worked with the University of Idaho Library as the [Digital Initiatives Librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html) in the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) (CDIL) department since the fall of 2023. My work generally consists of creating and maintaining our digital collections, working with CDIL fellowship recipients, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department.

## Why?

This work was completely inspired out of necessity for a masterâ€™s in History with the University of Idaho in the fall of 2024 while also working as a faculty member with the library. I wanted to think about creating a note taking system that could visualize connections across many different books that would be beneficial for creating historiographies specifically, but would also be helpful while creating literature reviews, scientific reviews and environmental scans.

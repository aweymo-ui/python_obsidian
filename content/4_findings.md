Regarding the limitations of data-driven, human-edited tagging, program managers should clarify that automated tags are only a starting point and may be incorrectly applied, missing, or require broader application across transcripts. Also, the amount of detail this process accrues is drastic and one could argue that the density of the data now makes it difficult for the researcher to navigate, especially on mobile devices, which remains a topic for ongoing refinement.

My hope is that utilizing machine learning, Python, and JavaScript approaches will make digitizing these resources more efficient and accessible, promoting their preservation and availability to the public.

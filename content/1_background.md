**Hello, my name is Andrew Weymouth** and I have worked with the University of Idaho Library as the [Digital Initiatives Librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html) in the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) (CDIL) department since the fall of 2023. My work generally consists of creating and maintaining our digital collections, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department.

**Established in 2008**, the CDIL maintains over 130 digital collections built from the open-source frameworks CollectionBuilder and Oral History as Data (OHD). The latter enables researchers to explore oral history collections through customized subject tags created by the transcriber depending on the recordingâ€™s content and themes.

**This project was initially inspired** by discovering gaps in our oral history transcripts following a data migration over the winter of 2023. Because of the volume of the material that needed generating, it was worthwhile to rethink workflows for overall efficiency and accuracy.
